# Personal Website 👁

Hey I am Anweshan. You probably know me as **anrcry**. This is a special repository for me as I maintain my personal website through this. This is the only project which recieves the most updates by me. To be very honest, I learnt the very basics of `Markdown`, `git`, *Github Actions* etc maintaing this repository.

## Some (un)wanted info 😑

### A little history about the username?

I was searching for a username which would be a part of my full name. I first thought of *anarchy*. That did not work as it was taken on most social media accounts or just not allowed on some. Then I twisted the same to *anrchy*. Surprise Surprise 😯, the username violated the "GitHub Trademark Policy" (whatever that is 🤷🏻‍♂️). Finally I settled on **anrcry**. To my joy, it was available on GitHub and all social media apps (provided they allowed me to change my "username") 🥳.

That settles the debate. My username is *anrcry...* (No one is crying, except me 😄).
