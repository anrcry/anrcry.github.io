## Branches & Tags

### Branches 🌿

As a rule of thumb, a *major version* of my website will always be stacked under a branch. For eg, all rollouts under the branch [v1](https://github.com/anrcry/anrcry.github.io/tree/v1) signifies to the version 1 of the website.

### Tags 🏷

There may be multiple tags (or releases) under each branch. Each of these release is a *minor update* adding a stable feature to the branch itself.
